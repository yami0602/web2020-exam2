# Final exam
## Question 1

Create a responsive layout with two circles directly inside the body of your html. You must use flexbox. **Do not use media queries.**

The circles should stack on top of one another on screen sizes lower than 400px, as in the picture:

## Question 2

Convert your chat layout to SASS. Here are the minimum requirements:

* You need four SASS partials. One for the common elements, one for the login screen, one for the chat screen, and one for the message boxes (the actual chat messages).
* Use variables for the text color and main background color.
* Use nested SASS selectors for things that only apply within the login screen or the chat screen.

## Question 3 (optional)

Convert your personal website to SASS and convert your portfolio section to a similar format to that presented in question 1 (responsive flexbox with no media queries).

Use one of the following pens to animate your portfolio items:
